Project made while going through the TOP curriculum
By the end of this project, I expect to have put to practice everything
I learned so far in the curriculum, including HTML, CSS, and by this point,
more specifically, using flex to lay out the elements on the page.

Project finished, I'm happy with the result, and feel like I have exercised my HTML and CSS knowledge
to a good extent. 
Beware: This is not a flexible layout, and it's not meant to be. This is reserved to a future moment
in the TOP curriculum.
